# The Four Color Challenge

Game developed for PROCJAM2024 (the Procedural Generation Jam) hosted by [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/procjam).

This project was developed with C++ and the [Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/index.html).

It is a map coloring game inspired by the[ four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem). In each round, the player is given a procedurally generated map and, using at most four colors, the player must color each region of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.

You can check the project's video demo for a quick look or play it at itch.io (LINKS WILL COME LATER...).
